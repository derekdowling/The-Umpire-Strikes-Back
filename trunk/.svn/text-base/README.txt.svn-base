Umpire Strikes Back!
team: Northlights App Studio
members: Nathaniel Rossol, Matthew Church, Derek Dowling, Chris Rossol


The Umpire has made a bad call and the baseball stadium has gone into a riot, throwing whatever they can get their hands on! Protect the umpire from waves of objects thrown by angry fans to prevent him from ending the game.


Game-play:
Waves of objects are thrown at the Umpires and the player must protect them by launching baseballs. The Umpire has a short fuse, if he is hit 3 times he will call the game, causing the game to be forfeited. The player is rewarded by knocking objects away from the Umpire, landing shots that place objects in the garbage can, and successfully completing the level.


Objects:
Baseball (thrown by player)
Hot dog (short, light)
Pop can (short, heavy)
Popcorn container (medium, light)
Baseball bat (medium, heavy)
Vuvuzela (long, light)
